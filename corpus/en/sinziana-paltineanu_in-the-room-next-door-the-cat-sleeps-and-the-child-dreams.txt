in the room next door . the cat sleeps and the child dreams
don’t dada me 
courage . these words 
encourage these words to dig holes . to cut tentacles 
look . the woman is sitting on the couch . thick-fringed eyes and open mouth 
the world outside begins to swarm with dark-winged words coming out of her mouth as she begins to whisper “tell me 
when did you stop remembering your dreams? tell me
what does the biological mean to you?” 
words-bats with 720 sexes each launch themselves into seemingly blind flights and crisscross the courtyard
dada me into sleep 
my dreams . your dreams . inter-galactic dreams 
do you remember those days when we exchanged dreams? 
those days were many 
first thing in the morning over breakfast . you would ask me what i had dreamed
and you and she and i – a kid with two moms – we all did the same and knew that the dreams were crafted for the dream-talk ritual 
usually . our dreams had something about each other . you were in my dream . i was in yours . she was in ours . we were in hers . or at least you or i or the cat
talking about the weather . talking about our dreams
don’t dada me
the child sleeps and the cat dreams
