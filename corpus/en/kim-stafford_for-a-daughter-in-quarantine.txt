For a Daughter in Quarantine

It’s all so like a dream as in my mind I drive 
the empty streets to find you across the river, 
then east and north, all trees in wild blossom. 
In my mind, I descend the steps to your 
basement den—with food, drink, music, 
we sit together, your stories and mine.

I’m old, may catch it, be gone. Or you…
or both of us. It was always possible, but 
now we live in acceleration of the possible. 
I always wanted your independence, and 
now we have it—I here writing this,
and you there, in danger, brave.

Child, girl, woman—it’s okay. 
From far, we live this day.
