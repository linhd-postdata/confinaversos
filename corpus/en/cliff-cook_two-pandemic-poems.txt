Two Pandemic Poems
              
                1.
          
            Silence

There is the unsettling
Silence of the streets
In the ‘city that never sleeps’

Where masked people hurry by
And feel alone and no one greets

There is the silence of the aerodrome
With just one copper on the beat
And all the flights have flown

There is the silence of the teacher
With no one to teach
There is the silence of the rainswept beach

There is the silence of the singer
Who cannot sing
There is the silence of the Silent Spring


There is the silence of the writer
Isolated in her flat
Bereft of speech.



                  2.

      Resurgence

Nature comes creeping back
The downtrod plant grows upright
Roots pierce tarmac

Roads like cataracts
-The morning saw their overkill-
Are hushed and still

Birds reclaim streets
That once were fields
And, in the silence, clear and sweet

Their voices sound. In morning light
The air is fresh. The chemical haze
Has cleared away and in the night

Instead of amber glare
The sky is bright with constellations
From Orion to the Great Bear.

As mating frogs their sticky spawn release
And migrating herons, grey and white
Weave shifting patterns in their ceaseless flight

The urgent Spring-time surges
Flowering plants proliferate
In uncut roadside verges

Revisited surprizes
And over mountains, sea and hills
A huge, full, moon-disc rises
